Direct Translator from Constraint Programming to Satisfiability Modulo Theories

## Info
C++ reboot of my Bachelor Thesis that aims to create a transpiler to compare two solving paradigms, with a novel approach that examines their different methods to tackle the same problem.
The Minizinc to SMTLibV2 transpiler automatically translates constraint satisfaction problems (Minizinc) into Satisfiability Modulo Theories problems (SMTLibV2).
The purpose of this project is to compare different solvers of different paradigms on the same problems.
